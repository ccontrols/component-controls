import { Playground, Story } from '@component-controls/blocks';
import { customStory } from '../../stories/external/external-story-props';

## Overview

You can create interactive component examples (aka stories) similar to [ESM](/tutorial/esmodules-stories) in [MDX](/tutorial/mdx-documentation)

To do so, you need to import some components from **'@component-controls/blocks'** and use them inside your MDX files

## Advantages

The MDX format has the following advantages:

- You have full control over your documentation, testing and design pages.
- You can include custom markdown documentation text.

The MDX format has the following dis-advantages:

- Documentation pages are not automatically created.
- IDE code-completion and linting support will be sub-par for now.

## File extensions

The MDX story files need to have an `.mdx` file extension and they should contain at least one `Story` componnet (if not, they are treated as regular [MDX documentation](/tutorial/mdx-documentation) pages);


## Example

```jsx
---
title: First Story
---
import { Button } from '../components/Button';
import { Playground, Story, PropsTable,  ComponentSource, StorySource  } from '@component-controls/blocks';

# My first doc story

<ComponentSource of={Button} title="Component source" />

<Playground description="Button story">
  <Story name="simple">
    <Button>
      click me
  </Button>
  </Story>
</Playground>

<StorySource id="." />

<PropsTable of={Button} />
```

## External stories

You can import [ESM](/tutorial/esmodules-stories) stories into your MDX documentation. Usually this is to use the benefits of writing your stories in `.tsx`/`.jsx` files with full code completion support from your code editor.

Our instrumenting module will take care to show the actual story source imported, not the code in the MDX file doing the importing.

```
---
title: External Story
---
import { Playground, Story } from '@component-controls/blocks';
import { customStory } from '../../stories/src/stories/external/external-story-props';

<Playground description="story from external file with props">
  <Story name='mdx-external-story' controls={{ text: 'hello' }} >
    {props => customStory(props)}
  </Story>
</Playground>

```
In the example below, click on `open source` to view the imported story source.

<Playground>
  <Story name='mdx-external-story' controls={{ text: 'hello' }} >
    {props => customStory(props)}
  </Story>
</Playground>


## Components

Below is a list of the most commonly used components (aka blocks) when writing MDX stories:


## Story-related

### Playground

Component to display a live playground of component examples. Has custom actions for zooming, switching direction, reviewing story source and configuration.

[Story](/api/blocks-story--overview)

### StoryConfig

Displays the configuration object of a story.

[StoryConfig](/api/blocks-storyconfig--overview)


### StorySource

[StorySource](/api/blocks-storysource--overview)

### Subtitle

Displays a subtitle as assigned to the story.subtitle field

## Component-related

### PropsTable

Displays the component's properties as well as configurable controls to interact with the component.

[PropsTable](/api/blocks-propstable--overview)


### ComponentSource

Displays import statement for a component as well as the component file source code Optionally also displays some repository information from the component's package.json

[ComponentSource](/api/blocks-componentsource--overview)


### Description

Description component with markdown. The 'of' property can specify which component's description to display.

[Description](/api/blocks-description--overview)


### ComponentDeps

Displays external dependencies for a component

## Document-related

### Stories

Displays multiple stories in ther own [Playground](#playground) components.

[Stories](/api/blocks-stories--overview)


### TagsList

Displays a row of tags assigned to the current document, with links to their pages
