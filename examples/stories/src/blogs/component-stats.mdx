# Addon stats

We just published the new jsx instrumenting feature and related cross/usage jsx components statistics for component-controls. 

This unique feature allows you to view the jsx trees of your componemts and answer to questions such as - which of my components is the most used as a building block, and which attributes of each component are most used.


# JSX Tree display

This is displayed on the documentation page of each component, where you can see a tree of jsx nodes and the attributes used in each node. 

Here is a live example of [BlockContainer](/api/components-blockcontainer--overview) component:

<Playground>
  <ComponentJSX of={BlockContainer} />
</Playground>  

# Addon-stats

The addon stats contains several api functions, react hooks and ui elements to make it easy to display cross-usage statistics on the components in your documentation site.
